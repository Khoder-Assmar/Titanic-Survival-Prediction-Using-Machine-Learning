# Overview
- This project focuses on predicting Titanic survivors using advanced classification techniques, incorporating detailed preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning. It leverages a combination of pipelines and classifiers to achieve high predictive accuracy, identifying key factors related to survival.

- The analysis is performed in Python and includes data cleaning, handling missing values, model selection, and performance evaluation.

# Project Overview
- This analysis uses Titanic dataset features such as age, sex, ticket class, and family size to predict survival outcomes. The goal is to build an accurate classification model, revealing key insights into survival patterns.

# Key Insights

- Feature Importance: Passenger class (Pclass), gender, and age emerged as the most significant predictors of survival.
- Survival Patterns: Clear trends show higher survival rates for first-class passengers, females, and younger individuals.
- Model Performance: Through the application of optimized machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Classifiers, an accuracy of 83% was achieved, demonstrating the model's reliability.
# Tools & Libraries

- Python: Primary language used for data processing and model building.
- Pandas: Used for efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Helped create visualizations for model evaluation and survival analysis.
- Scikit-learn: Employed for building and fine-tuning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVC, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
